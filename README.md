We should develop a network which does not depend on cellular network or landline(bluetooth) and even synchronization of patient data and medical records to ensure proper care in the event of a natural disaster.
We  should develop sensors with greater sensitivity and greater data capabilities, and deploying them quickly and cost-effectively will help with disaster prediction efforts. 
We should develop advanced IOT applications .
